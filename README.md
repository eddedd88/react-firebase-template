Bootstrap a full stack application with pre-configured: hosting, database, authentication, CI, CD, component library, state management, form utils.

This template tries to make as many opinionated choices as possible about the dev stack in order to quickly build a product that could sustain a significant amount of traffic/users.

For this template to work all you will need is a Firebase project. I recommend using their free tier to start off.

## Tech Stack Choices:
- **[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)** as the project's starting point, using the *cra-template-pwa-typescript* template, this includes: **React**, **Typescript**, bundling tool pre-configured, **Jest** for testing, and **PWA** pre-configured.
- **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)** for Hosting, Database (Firestore) with offline mode enabled, and Authentication.
- **Github Actions** to automate tests and deploys
- **[material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui)** component library.
- **[recoil](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil)** for state management.
- **[react-hook-form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form)** for building forms quickly.
- **[react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)** for writing tests

## Getting Started
After starting your repo with this template you need to configure your Firebase project by following these steps:
- Make sure you have enabled all the **Firebase** services you wish to use in your project
- Copy your firebase config located at *Firebase Project > Project Settings > Firebase SDK snippet > Config*
- Paste the firebase config to `src/firebase/firebase.ts` for the respective environment
- Set your *Firebase Project* as *default* at `.firebaserc`

### Automate Deploys to Firebase hosting
CI tests are configured out of the box, but to enable deploys to Firebase do the following:
- Create a Firebase Auth Token locally: `yarn firebase login:ci`
- Add the Firebase token to Github as a *secret* called `FIREBASE_TOKEN`. You can add secrets at *Github Project > Settings > Secrets*.
- Open the file `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and uncomment the lines `46-51` 

Every time a commit is pushed to github, Github will automatically run the CI tests; and every time there is a push to master Github will deploy the new version to Firebase. See the ci workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for more details.

## Development
In two separate terminal windows run the commands: `yarn start:server` and `yarn start`. The Firebase server is run as an emulator locally, this means that it won't use any quota for your Firebase project.

The Firebase instance in this template has been extended with Typescript to enforce a defined database schema. This is hooked up in `src/models/FirestoreCollectionPaths.ts`.

## Testing
I recommend following the **react-testing-library** advice of writing tests that closely resemble the way your app is used. This means writing more integration tests where you render the whole app and then test actual user functionalities.

You can find some functions to help with rendering the app and mocking Firestore collections in the `/test-utils` folder. Here is an example of a test:
```
import renderApp from '../test-utils/renderApp'
import { mockCollection } from '../test-utils/firebaseMocks'

test('display all pets', () => {
  mockCollection('pets', { id: 'test', name: 'Abc' })
  const view = renderApp()
  expect(view.getByText('Abc')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```
